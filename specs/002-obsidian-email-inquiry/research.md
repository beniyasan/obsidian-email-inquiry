# Research Findings: Obsidian Email Inquiry Management System

**Date**: 2025-09-05  
**Feature**: 002-obsidian-email-inquiry

## Executive Summary
Research conducted to resolve specification clarifications and establish technical approach for the Obsidian email inquiry management plugin. All NEEDS CLARIFICATION items from the specification have been addressed with concrete decisions.

## Clarification Resolutions

### 1. Email Field Extraction (FR-006)
**Decision**: Extract sender, subject, date, body, attachments list, and custom tags  
**Rationale**: These are standard email fields that provide sufficient context for inquiry management  
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Full header extraction (rejected - too complex for user needs)
- Body-only extraction (rejected - loses important context)

### 2. Email Thread Grouping (FR-009)
**Decision**: Group by subject line similarity and In-Reply-To headers when available  
**Rationale**: Standard email threading approach that users expect  
**Alternatives considered**:
- No grouping (rejected - loses conversation context)
- Time-based grouping (rejected - may incorrectly group unrelated emails)

### 3. Bulk Import Sources (FR-010)
**Decision**: Support .eml files, .mbox archives, and CSV exports  
**Rationale**: Covers most common email export formats  
**Alternatives considered**:
- Direct IMAP connection (rejected - security complexity)
- Copy-paste only (rejected - inefficient for bulk operations)

### 4. Inquiry Statistics (FR-011)
**Decision**: Track daily/weekly/monthly volume, top categories, average resolution time, and common keywords  
**Rationale**: Provides actionable insights without overwhelming users  
**Alternatives considered**:
- Simple count only (rejected - insufficient for pattern detection)
- Complex analytics (rejected - beyond plugin scope)

### 5. Data Retention (FR-013)
**Decision**: Indefinite retention with optional archive after 1 year  
**Rationale**: Obsidian users expect permanent notes; archiving keeps vault manageable  
**Alternatives considered**:
- Auto-delete after period (rejected - data loss risk)
- No archiving (rejected - performance impact with large volumes)

### 6. Expected Volume (FR-014)
**Decision**: Optimize for 50-100 emails per day, test up to 500/day  
**Rationale**: Covers typical support team volume with headroom  
**Alternatives considered**:
- Lower limit (rejected - too restrictive)
- Higher limit (rejected - requires different architecture)

## Technical Research

### Obsidian Plugin Architecture
**Decision**: Use Obsidian Plugin API 1.4+ with TypeScript  
**Rationale**: Official supported approach with good documentation  
**Key findings**:
- Plugins run in Electron environment with Node.js access
- Can create custom views, commands, and settings
- File operations through Vault API
- Search through MetadataCache API

### Email Parsing Approach
**Decision**: Use mailparser library for .eml, node-mbox for .mbox  
**Rationale**: Mature libraries with good encoding support  
**Key findings**:
- Handle various encodings (UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, etc.)
- Extract attachments as separate notes
- Preserve HTML structure as markdown

### Markdown Frontmatter Schema
**Decision**: YAML frontmatter with standardized fields  
**Rationale**: Native Obsidian support, queryable via Dataview  
**Schema**:
```yaml
---
email-id: unique-identifier
sender: email@example.com
subject: Email Subject
date: 2025-09-05T10:30:00Z
status: pending|resolved|archived
tags: [tag1, tag2]
category: support|sales|other
thread-id: thread-identifier
---
```

### Daily Summary Generation
**Decision**: Virtual file generated on-demand, cached for performance  
**Rationale**: Avoids duplicate data while providing quick access  
**Key findings**:
- Use Dataview queries for aggregation
- Cache results for 5 minutes
- Regenerate on email status changes

### Knowledge Base Indexing
**Decision**: Use Obsidian's built-in search with custom operators  
**Rationale**: Leverages existing search UI and indexing  
**Implementation**:
- Tag-based categorization
- Link-based relationships
- Full-text search on email body

### Performance Optimization
**Decision**: Lazy loading, pagination, and incremental indexing  
**Rationale**: Maintains responsiveness with large vaults  
**Strategies**:
- Load emails in batches of 50
- Index new emails on creation
- Background processing for bulk imports

## Best Practices Identified

### Obsidian Plugin Development
1. Use Workspace API for UI components
2. Implement settings tab for configuration
3. Handle vault events for real-time updates
4. Provide command palette actions
5. Support mobile and desktop platforms

### Data Organization
1. One note per email for atomic updates
2. Folder structure: /Emails/YYYY/MM/DD/
3. Separate folder for knowledge entries
4. Tags for cross-cutting categorization

### User Experience
1. Drag-and-drop for email import
2. Quick capture via hotkey
3. Template support for resolution notes
4. Bulk actions for categorization

## Risk Mitigation

### Performance Risks
- **Risk**: Large email volumes slow down vault
- **Mitigation**: Implement pagination and lazy loading

### Data Integrity
- **Risk**: Corrupt email import loses data  
- **Mitigation**: Validation before import, backup original files

### Search Performance
- **Risk**: Full-text search becomes slow
- **Mitigation**: Use indexed fields in frontmatter

## Conclusion
All specification clarifications have been resolved with concrete technical decisions. The research confirms feasibility of implementing all functional requirements within Obsidian's plugin architecture. The approach prioritizes simplicity and performance while meeting user needs for email inquiry management.

## Next Steps
1. Create detailed data model based on decisions
2. Define plugin API contracts
3. Generate test scenarios from requirements
4. Build quickstart guide for users
