# Feature Specification: Obsidian Email Inquiry Management System

**Feature Branch**: `002-obsidian-email-inquiry`  
**Created**: 2025-09-05  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Obsidian email inquiry management tool that captures raw email content, provides daily summaries, and accumulates knowledge base"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an Obsidian user managing customer inquiries, I want to quickly capture incoming email content into my vault, organize emails by date, and build a searchable knowledge base from accumulated inquiries so that I can efficiently handle support requests and identify common patterns.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new inquiry email is received, **When** the user copies the email content to the tool, **Then** the system creates a new note in Obsidian with the raw email content preserved and properly tagged
2. **Given** multiple emails have been captured, **When** the user requests a daily summary, **Then** the system displays all inquiries received on that date with key metadata
3. **Given** accumulated email data over time, **When** the user searches for specific topics or patterns, **Then** the system provides relevant knowledge insights from past inquiries
4. **Given** an email note exists, **When** the user adds resolution notes or tags, **Then** the system updates the knowledge base with this new information

### Edge Cases
- What happens when duplicate emails are captured?
- How does system handle emails with attachments or embedded images?
- What occurs when email content contains special Obsidian formatting characters?
- How does the system handle very large email threads?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST capture raw email content and preserve original formatting
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically organize emails by date received
- **FR-003**: System MUST generate daily summary views of all inquiries for a given date
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to tag and categorize captured emails
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide search capability across all captured email content
- **FR-006**: System MUST extract and index key information from emails [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what specific fields - sender, subject, date, or custom fields?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST accumulate knowledge from resolved inquiries for future reference
- **FR-008**: Users MUST be able to add resolution notes and follow-up information to email records
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle email threads and conversations [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should it group related emails together?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST support bulk import of existing emails [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: from what sources - email clients, CSV, other formats?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide statistics on inquiry patterns [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what metrics - volume by date, common topics, response times?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST integrate with Obsidian's existing tagging and linking system
- **FR-013**: Data MUST be retained [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period and deletion policy not specified]
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: expected volume of emails per day/week/month not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Email Inquiry**: Represents a captured email with sender information, subject, body content, timestamp, status, and associated tags
- **Daily Summary**: Aggregated view of all inquiries received on a specific date with counts and categorization
- **Knowledge Entry**: Extracted insight or resolution from processed inquiries, linked to original emails
- **Tag/Category**: Classification labels for organizing and searching inquiries
- **Resolution Note**: Follow-up information added to an inquiry including solution provided and outcome
